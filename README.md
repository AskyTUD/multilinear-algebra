# Multilinear Algebra
The multilinear algebra module provides methods for defining and computing contravariant and/or covariant objects. 
According to the Einstein notation, objects can be added, subtracted, multiplied (inner and outer product). 
Moreover, different ways of representing the objects are available. 

### Additional Packages
In order to use the functions of the toolbox, the following packages need to be installed:
